\section{Project Description}
Server holds any number of checkers games, clients connect at any time 
to check current game state and make next move. Server does not validate 
the moves according to the rules, the only checks server does:

\begin{itemize}

	\item    is it player's turn ?
	\item    is disc of player colour at the starting position ?
	\item    is destination position empty or occupied by the opponent piece ? 
	\item    If empty, just make a move, if occupied, remove opponents disc.
    
\end{itemize}

Game is over when one of the players give up 
(server does not check the terminal rules of checkers game).

{\bf When connected to the game user can:}

\begin{itemize}

	\item display the board
    \item check game status (active,resolved, waiting for opponent)
	\item check the turn (mine,opponents)
	\item list all moves made
	\item read messages from the opponent
	\item make move in form of coordinates e.g. b6 to c6
	\item leave any number of messages to the opponent
	\item give up

\end{itemize}

{\bf When connected to the server user can:}

\begin{itemize}

    \item identify himself with nick (no passwords)
    \item connect to the game of given id (only, if he is the player in this game)
    \item list all games connected to him (by nick)
    \item start a new game:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item if there is no other new game on the server 
        \item new game with status "waiting for opponent" is started
        \item if there is a new game without a opponent, the player joins this game
        \item id and status of a new game is sent to the player
	\end{itemize}        
\end{itemize}

All game data must be stored in folders and files. 
All network communication is based on tcp. 
Server does not remove resolved games. 
Each client connection must be handled by it's own process. 
All interprocess communication must be based on sysV IPC.

\section{Modules}
Source files are stored in $src$ folder and contains the following modules

\begin{itemize}
	\item util - all the common utility functions
	\item server - server related stuff
	\item client - client related stuff
\end{itemize}
