Server programme accepts number of TCP clients (less than FD_SETSIZE). 
Each client at any time can send positive 
(excluding zero) integer to the server.

If server have 2 clients with the same number both are disconnected.
If client sends multiple numbers only the last one 
is remembered on the server.

Any data that is not in form of positive integer 
(as text) should be ignored. 

Server is a single process programme.

Server program can be interrupted by C-c (SIGINT) at any time

Server takes port number as its sole argument.

Telnet will be used as client program e.g.: telnet localhost 2000
