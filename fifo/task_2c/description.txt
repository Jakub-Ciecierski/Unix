One parent and ten children. In a loop (until there are any children):

parent selects (randomly) some positive number,
each child selects (randomly) some positive number and sends it to the parent,

the child that sent the value closest to the parent's value "wins",

parent sends to all children the information which child (PID)
is the winner of that round,

winner prints its PID and exits. 

Parent communicates with its children using two 
(and only two!) shared pipes. No other means for 
interprocess communication (signals, message queues,
files etc) can be used!
